They come in many varieties: some are full bodied, often with wings; others are simply disembodied that simply watch having only half a body. Gargoyles are not the same as other stone beings, such as the Golems are always in the form of in-human,but the gargoyle only become flesh and bone at night. They stand guard in Gothic style structures, such as Cathedrals and European castles.</p> 

    <p>It has also been said that Gargoyles only come alive to fend off evil, which would explain them being found on churches commonly. So there is a possibility that Gargoyles just look evil and scary to fend off bad intruders. So nobody actually knows if a gargoyle is evil or good.</p>
