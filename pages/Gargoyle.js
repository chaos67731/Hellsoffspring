var description = `
    A Gargoyle is a living monster that was made of a stone and brought to life by magic. Theyonly come to life during the night. They come in many varieties: some are full bodied, often with wings; others are simply disembodied that simply watch having only half a body. Gargoyles are not the same as other stone beings, such as the Golems are always in the form of in-human,but the gargoyle only become flesh and bone at night. They stand guard in Gothic style structures, such as Cathedrals and European castles. 

    It has also been said that Gargoyles only come alive to fend off evil, which would explain them being found on churches commonly. So there is a possibility that Gargoyles just look evil and scary to fend off bad intruders. (It is also said in some legends that they are a type of lesser guardian angel that is sometimes often considered to be an abomination due to the fact that they are half angel half demon.) So nobody actually knows if a gargoyle is evil or good.
