    <p>Werewolves are humanoid creatures that are very tall and hairy. They are humans and only turn into a Werewolf at night. The werewolf is a widespread concept in folklore, existing in many different places. They were most popular during the medieval period. From the early modern period, Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches, in the course of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in Switzerland in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th century, and hitting a high point in the 18th century.
